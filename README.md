History
-------

This was a bookmark manager written in PHP that indexed bookmarks from html files exported from Chrome and Firefox.

My browsers used to crash because I had over a thousand bookmarks, so I needed a way to store and search through the bookmarks, hence the need for this.

It was only later that I realize how badly this was done. I don't even remember how this works anymore.

However, instead of just deleting it like I do with most of my other mini-projects, I will port this to Python and hopefully continue using it.

Usage
-----
As far as I remember, you store all files to be indexed in a folder and then run the script locally.
(Can't dare to read the file because it brings back horrible memories. And guilt.)
